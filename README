What this is

The Problem:
We have a problem on our project (http://ooici.net/): We're writing multiprocessing messaging-based
code with a single logfile/stream, using Python logging. The problem is trying to
decipher what's going wrong from the intermingled log messages.

The Idea:
What you want to see is a message sequence chart, where there's a column in a browser
for each process/thread, and the vertical axis is time.

The Technology:
1) html5 canvas, used as simple (x,y, text)
2) jquery (for event hooks, viewport size)
3) python + twisted to create a RESTful server
4) javascript to pull and display

A sketch of the goal:
- The python code, with its richer libraries and easy filesystem access, is responsible for
  loading and parsing the logfile into a set of arrays. It needs to have timestamps as time_t
  so that the javascript can scale the Y axis correctly.
- The python code then presents a REST API on TCP:2200. Currently implemented
  - get_configuration returns a json object with num_columns and an array of column names.
  - stub code for returning a log message based on a column name and index
- The JS code
 - Pulls the config
 - Draws the canvas (full window)
 - Writes the column headers

 Lots of work left! Here's a screenshot of the current state of the code, showing the above:
